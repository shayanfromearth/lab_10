## beepr beep beep doodoo

Use the function `beep()` in the beepr package to make an audio alert when your code is done running. I like `beep(8)` ... good beep.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (i in rev(seq(1:99))) {
  
  print(paste(i, "bottles of beer on the wall"))
}

beep(4) # this makes an audio alert for when it's done
```

## praise and cowsay

Packages built with a single purpose: to be kind and fun.

```{r}
praise("${Exclamation}, ${EXCLAMATION}... ${exclamation}!!!!")

praise("Holy ${exclamation}, Batman - this code is ${ADJECTIVE}!")
```

Use cowsay::say() to make a character say something to you

Use `usethis::edit_r_profile()` to get to r profile and edit this

Use `usethis::use_git()` in the console to commit a file to Git after starting the document already not on version control

Use `usethis::use_github()` to create a repo

## paletteer to access thousands of color palettes

```{r}
storms %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(min_pressure = min(pressure, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  slice_min(n = 10, min_pressure) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = min_pressure, y = name)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = name)) +
  scale_fill_paletteer_d("palettetown::milotic")
```
